Hi. I'm Aldo. I'm a guy who codes things.

The only project I maintain right now is [`souvlaki`](https://github.com/Sinono3/souvlaki). It's a media key handling library I made back in 2021. I usually just respond to issues and merge pull requests, but I don't do much other than that.
It was used in [`psst`](https://github.com/jpochyla/psst), which is a big project and made `souvlaki` receive lots of
attention.

If you'd like to contact me you can go [here](@/contact.md), I'll make sure to respond.
