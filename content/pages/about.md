Hi. I'm Aldo. I'm currently (Jan. 2024) a third-semester student of Information Engineering (kind of like Software Engineering)
in Taiwan-Paraguay Polytechnic University (臺灣-巴拉圭科技大學). Since starting university, I've had less time for my
own projects and FOSS (turns out I like studying).

The only project I "maintain" right now is [`souvlaki`](https://github.com/Sinono3/souvlaki). It's a media key handling library I
made back in 2021. I usually just respond to issues and merge pull requests, but I don't do much other than that.
It was used in [`psst`](https://github.com/jpochyla/psst), which is a big project and made `souvlaki` receive lots of
attention.

If you'd like to contact me you can go [here](@/pages/contact.md), I'll make sure to respond.
