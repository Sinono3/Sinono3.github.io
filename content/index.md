# The site

Welcome to my site. I'm Aldo Acevedo. I'm 17 years old. I am also known as *Sinono3*. In terms of serious things, I'm a programmer and a student. As a hobby, I make and listen to music. When I'm in the mood for it, I also play games. 

The main programming language I work with is Rust. I am no professional, but I've gotten a lot better since I started in 2018. I can also get by in C#, Python, GDScript.

I love free software and Linux. I love the Unix philosophy. I hate bloated software to the core. I dislike the idea of propietary software in general, but I guess it's more tolerable. 

My current distro is Artix, though that will probably change soon (I'll be trying Void Linux). My window manager is bspwm. If you want a closer look at my setup, [here are my dotfiles](https://github.com/Sinono3/dotfiles). Beware though, the repo is not formatted for the public eye to see.

## Current projects

These are the projects that I'm intermittently maintaining, and promoting.

- [`souvlaki`](https://github.com/Sinono3/souvlaki): A media key handling library.
- [`canved`](https://github.com/Sinono3/canved): A lightweight and minimalistic image editor for Unix systems.
- [`quiren`](https://github.com/Sinono3/quiren): Edits the filenames of the current directory on the editor of your choice.

## Old/abandoned projects

These are projects that I have abandoned due to simply a lack of interest or due to various reasons.

- [`aldoc`](https://github.com/Sinono3/aldoc): A markup language inspired by Markdown. **Abandoned because there were better alternatives, and I realized that whitespace-based markup languages were a bad idea.** When I have the time, I'll make `aldoc_next` ðŸ˜¼
- [`silas`](https://github.com/Sinono3/silas): A cat feeding database, accesible from the browser. Its purpose is to prevent the feeding the cat more times than necessary. It was my first real incursion into JS, I didn't know anything. In the end my cat still got fat ðŸ˜¿
- `rwebgarden`: An auto plant waterer, configurable via a website and powered by a Raspberry Pi Zero. The fact that it even worked was honestly pretty cool. The repo is private, but I might make it public. To do the actual watering of the plants, a fishtank pump was used. I used a relay to activate it via the GPIO, and it actually was pretty dangerous because the pump required an extremely high voltage.

## Games I've made

In my experience, making games is a **lot** harder than just programming libraries or tools. Mainly because I suck at game design. Mainly because I don't even play videogames as often. Most games I've worked on have never been finished, it's a recurring problem with gamedevs that are too ambitious, such as me in the past.

Sadly, a lot of games I've made have been lost. In 2018 I formatted the wrong partition and lost a lot of data (I've learned my lessonðŸ¥²). Thankfully, I still have the binaries for most lost games. Anyways, you can see a list of all the games I've worked on in the [Games](/games) section.
