I recently realized I stopped associating myself with things. This is likely a consequence of the introduction of Buddhist ideas in my mind. I realized this as I found myself in a situation where I needed to make a short introduction of myself. What do I say?

The first idea that came to my mind was to mention **what** I usually do. So, I study. I use computers a lot throughout the day. I listen to music. I don't even have a specific genre of music that I like particularly. I do strength training 3 times a week. I play video games. I read a bit, at night mostly. I write also. I frequently think about what I think. Thankfully, I don't have enough painful "whats" to include them here, in my attempt at an introduction.

Now the next level is to get more specific, **the what of the what**, the object. I study CS, due to *many* overlapping circumstances, but mainly because it's aligned to what I want to do in the future: be an ML researcher. About music I could mention genres, but they're always temporary, a lifespan of months, usually. About video games, I haven't recognized much of a pattern in the games I play except that they're kind of easy, and immersive, maybe. I read about... psychology, philosophy, biokinematics, math and physics, maybe politics. I write things like what you're reading: endless displays of self-absorption and narcissism. Just kidding.

The how is not that interesting.

**The why**. I find some whys to be more interesting to mention than others. Why do I want to be an ML researcher? Well, research excites me, and I think AI alignment will be good for humanity, and feeling that I'm helping humanity makes me happy. I listen to music because it's pleasant. I play video games because they're pleasant. It's not so complex.

But this is just the what and the how and the why now. I won't be like this in let's say, even 6 months from now on, the what, the how and the why will be different, for sure. Maybe minimally, or substantially. But that's the thing. I don't think of what I do usually. I just do it. I had to sit down and write down what and how and why I do.

I could also mention what I don't do and why, and talk about how my physionomy, my voice, or my corporal expressions and manner of speech or writing, or what I wear or what I eat or drink. But let's leave that for another time.

It was not always like this. Previously I did introduce myself as a music guy, a gamedev guy, a calisthenics guy or computer guy or whatever. Now no longer. I'm a nothing guy. Not in a bad way, but in a relieving way. But I'm not trying to be a "I'm a nothing guy" guy, or a "But I'm not trying to be a 'I'm a nothing guy' guy" guy. Not at any level of meta. Maybe that's the closest thing to what I actually think of myself as, a meta guy. But I hope to detach quickly from that, because association triggers value assignment, and value assignment triggers comparison, and the day I meet someone more meta than me, my ego will hurt, and negative emotions will arise. So, let's just stop for now, and leave it at that. Let's just forget about it all.
