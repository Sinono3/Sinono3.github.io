      <h1>Aldo Acevedo</h1>
<p>Third-year CS student at Universidad Politécnica Taiwán Paraguay, on two-year exchange at National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (2025-2026).</p>
<p>I'm interested in AI safety, and <strong>I'm actively steering my career towards technical alignment research.</strong>
I'm determined to deeply understand the inner workings of ML systems,
and find ways to make them robustly learn human preferences.</p>
<p>In the past, I've worked as software engineer, primarily in Rust, although not exclusively.
I have worked mainly in gamedev, though interspersed with some fullstack work here and there.</p>
<p>I've also <a href="music">published music</a> under various names, and <a href="games">made my own video games</a>. Check them out.</p>

<h3>projects</h3>
<p>I maintain some open-source projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Sinono3/souvlaki">souvlaki</a>: library for media applications to support OS media controls and &quot;Now Playing&quot; displays.
Normally, the app developer would need to manually interface with each OS's API. My library abstracts all that away.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Sinono3/obsidian-helix">obsidian-helix</a>: Obsidian plugin that enables Helix keybindings. Very simple codebase, as an underlying library is doing most of the heavy lifting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some notable past projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Sinono3/parrl">parrl</a>: From-scratch C++ implementation of batched Cartpole env and a corresponding NN policy. Had to manually implement (1) parallel backprop, (2) parallel environments and (3) vanilla policy gradient.
200x speed-up over Python version.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Sinono3/retroarcade">retroarcade</a>: Libretro frontend designed for kiosk-mode Linux-based arcade machines. Handles multiple systems, cover art, controller input, resetting and auto-scanning new ROMs.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Sinono3/quiren">quiren</a>: Minimal tool to bulk-rename filenames in the editor of your choice.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Sinono3/aldoc">aldoc</a>: Attempt at making my own markup language that compiles to LaTeX/PDF, back when I was unsatisfied with Pandoc.</li>
<li>TODO... add more here.</li>
</ul>
<h3>posts</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href=/posts/feature/>A Brief, Practical Introduction to Feature Visualization in PyTorch</a>: We need to understand deep learning models. But how? (2024-09-27)</li>
</ul>
